# Punk Records

Punk Records is a [Cubari](https://cubari.moe) repository for [TCB Scans](https://tcbscans.com)' _One Piece_ releases
and its automated maintainer, [Labosphere](labosphere). Read the releases
at [punkrecords.celsiusnarhwal.dev](https://punkrecords.celsiusnarhwal.dev).

This repository is updated automatically every day within one hour of 10:00 UTC, 22:00 UTC, and whenever TCB announces a new *One Piece* release in their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/tcbscans).

Chapters 997 and earlier don't currently have titles since TCB only started embedding titles into its website with
Chapter 998 (thus Labosphere can only retrieve them for Chapters 998 and later).
Contributions to resolve this are welcome.
